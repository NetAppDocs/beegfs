[.lead]
This NetApp Verified Architecture describes how to deploy BeeGFS on NetApp using validated BeeGFS file servers (referred to throughout as file nodes) attached to block storage systems (referred to throughout as block nodes) using the second generation of the NetApp BeeGFS building block design. This design takes advantage of the performance density delivered by the latest enterprise server and storage hardware and network speeds, requiring file nodes that feature dual AMD EPYC 7003 “Milan” processors and support for PCIe 4.0 with direct connects using 200Gb (HDR) InfiniBand to block nodes that provide end-to-end NVMe and NVMeOF using the NVMe/IB protocol.

== NetApp Verified Architecture program

The NetApp Verified Architecture program provides customers with reference configurations and sizing guidance for specific workloads and use cases. These solutions are:
• Thoroughly tested
• Designed to minimize deployment risks
• Designed to accelerate time to market
This document is for NetApp and partner solutions engineers and customer strategic decision makers. It describes the architecture design considerations that were used to determine the specific equipment, cabling, and configurations required to support the validated workload.


=== Use cases
The following use cases apply to this solution:

* AI including ML, DL, NLP, and NLU
* HPC including applications accelerated by MPI and other distributed computing techniques
* Application workloads characterized by:
** Reading or writing to files larger than 1GB
** Reading or writing to the same file by multiple clients (10s, 100s, and 1000s)
* Multi-terabyte or multi-petabyte datasets
* Environments that need a single storage namespace optimizable for a mix of large and small files

=== Benefits
In addition to being backed and supported by a leading on-premises and cloud storage provider, the key benefits of using BeeGFS on NetApp include:

* Availability of verified hardware designs providing full integration of hardware and software components to ensure predicable performance and reliability.
* Deployed and managed using Ansible for simplicity and consistency at scale.
* Monitoring and observability provided using the https://www.netapp.com/blog/monitoring-netapp-eseries/[E-Series Performance Analyzer and BeeGFS plugin^].
* High availability featuring a shared-disk architecture that provides data durability and availability.
* Support for https://www.netapp.com/blog/kubernetes-meet-beegfs/[modern workload management and orchestration^] using containers and Kubernetes.


== HA architecture

BeeGFS on NetApp expands the functionality of the BeeGFS enterprise edition by creating a fully integrated solution with NetApp hardware that enables a shared-disk high availability (HA) architecture.

NOTE: While the BeeGFS community edition can be used free of charge, the enterprise edition requires purchasing a professional support subscription contract from a partner like NetApp. The enterprise edition allows use of several additional features including resiliency, quota enforcement, and storage pools.

The following figure compares the shared-nothing and shared-disk high availability (HA) architectures.
