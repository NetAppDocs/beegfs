This site documents how to deploy and manage BeeGFS on NetApp using both NetApp Verified Architectures (NVAs) and custom architectures. NVA designs are thoroughly tested and provide customers with reference configurations and sizing guidance to minimize deployment risk and accelerate time to market. NetApp also supports custom BeeGFS architectures running on NetApp hardware, giving customers and partners flexibility designing file systems to meet a wide range of requirements. Both approaches leverage Ansible for deployment, providing an appliance-like approach managing BeeGFS at any scale across a flexible range of hardware.
