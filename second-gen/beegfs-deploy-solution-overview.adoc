This NetApp Verified Architecture describes how to deploy BeeGFS on NetApp to validated file and block nodes using the second generation of NetAppâ€™s BeeGFS building block design. This design takes advantage of the performance density delivered by the latest enterprise serverstorage hardware and network speedsrequi file nodes that feature dual AMD EPYC 7003Milan processors and support for PCIe Gen4 directly connected 200Gb (HDR) InfiniBand  provide end-to-end NVMe and NVMeOF the NVMe/IB protocol.

A benefit of parallel file systems like BeeGFS is their ability to be deployed and scaled out in different ways depending on the storage requirements. For example, use cases primarily featuring lots of small files will benefit from extra metadata performance and capacity, whereas use cases featuring fewer larger files can favor more storage capacity and performance for actual file contents.  There are multiple considerations that parallel file system deploymentcomplexity designing, deploying, and managing parallel file system.

To address these challenges,  NetApp has designed a standard building block architecture that is used to scale out each of these dimensions. Typically, BeeGFS building blocks are deployed in one of three configuration profiles:

* A single base building block, including BeeGFS management, metadata, and storage services
* A BeeGFS metadata + storage building block
* A BeeGFS storageonly building blockThe only (optional) hardware change between these three options is the use of smaller drives for BeeGFS metadata. Otherwise,  all configuration changes are applied through software, and Ansible makes it straightforward to set the profile for a building block.

This provides administrators the flexibility needed to quickly adapt to meet diverse and shifting workload requirements while using a scalable building block architecture and the latest available hardware. The solution also features a https://www.netapp.com/blog/high-availability-beegfs/[shared-disk high availability design^] that helps reduce cost without sacrificing performance or reliability, requiring enterprisegrade block nodes for data durability.

This deployment guide walk the reader through the steps needed to assemble second-generation NetApp BeeGFS hardware building blocks and deploy BeeGFS on NetApp using Ansible.  The intent is to equip the reader with the knowledge needed to design and deploy BeeGFS file systems using the standard building block architecture and any combination of these configuration profiles. Thus,  the BeeGFS deployment featured in this document show how to deploy a file system that consists of three building blocks, each configuring using one of the above profiles.

The following diagram shows the BeeGFS configuration used to validate this NetApp Verified Architecture.
