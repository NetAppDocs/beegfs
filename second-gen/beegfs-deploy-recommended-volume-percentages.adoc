When following the standard four volumes per storage pool configuration for second generation building blocks, refer to the following table.

This table provides recommended percentages to use as the volume size in the `eseries_storage_pool_configuration` for each BeeGFS metadata or storage target:

|===
|Drive size |Size

|1.92TB
|18
|3.84TB
|21.5
|7.68TB
|22.5
|15.3TB
|24
|===

[NOTE]
The above guidance does not apply to the storage pool containing the management service, which should reduce the sizes above by .25% to allocate 1% of the storage pool for management data.

To understand how these values were determined, see https://www.netapp.com/media/17009-tr4800.pdf[TR-4800: Appendix A: Understanding SSD endurance and overprovisioning^].
