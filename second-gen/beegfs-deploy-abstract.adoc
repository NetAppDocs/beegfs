This document describes how to assemble second-generation NetApp BeeGFS hardware building blocks and deploy the BeeGFS on NetApp shared-disk high availability solution. This guide walks through deploying a BeeGFS file system that consists of one base building block including management, metadata, and storage services, a second building block with metadata and storage services, and a third storage only building block.  This demonstrates the full range of recommended configuration “profiles” for NetApp BeeGFS building blocks. For each deployment the number of metadata and storage or storage only building blocks may vary from what is demonstrated here depending on capacity and performance requirements.
