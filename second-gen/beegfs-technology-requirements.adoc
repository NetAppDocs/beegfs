To implement the BeeGFS on NetApp solution, ensure your environment meets the technology requirements outlined in this document.

== Hardware requirements
Before you begin, ensure that your hardware meets the following specifications for a single second-generation building block design of the BeeGFS on NetApp solution. The exact components for a particular deployment may vary based on customer requirements.

|Quantity |Hardware component |Requirements

a|2
a|BeeGFS file nodes
a|Each file node should meet or exceed the specifications of the recommended file nodes to achieve expected performance.

*Recommended file node options:*

* *Lenovo ThinkSystem SR665 V3*
** *Processors:* 2x AMD EPYC 9124 16C 3.0 GHz (configured as two NUMA zones).
** *Memory:* 256GB (16x 16GB TruDDR5 4800MHz RDIMM-A)
** *PCIe Expansion:* Four PCIe Gen5 x16 slots (two per NUMA zone)
** *Miscellaneous:*

*** Two drives in RAID 1 for OS (1TB 7.2K SATA or better)
*** 1GbE port for in-band OS management
*** 1GbE BMC with Redfish API for out-of-band server management
*** Dual hot swap power supplies and performance fans

|E-Series block nodes (EF600 array)
a|*Memory:* 256GB (128GB per controller).
*Adapter:* 2-port 200Gb/HDR (NVMe/IB).
*Drives:* Configured to match desired metadata and storage capacity.

|8
|InfiniBand host card adapters (for file nodes).
a|Host card adapters will vary based on the server model used for the file node. Recommendations for verified file nodes include:

* *Lenovo ThinkSystem SR665 V3 Server:*
** MCX755106AS-HEAT ConnectX-7, NDR200, QSFP112, 2-port, PCIe Gen5 x16, InfiniBand Adapter

|1
|Storage network switch
a|The storage network switch must be capable of 200Gb/s InfiniBand speeds. Recommended switch models include:

* *NVIDIA QM9700 Quantum 2 NDR InfiniBand switch*
* *NVIDIA MQM8700 Quantum HDR InfiniBand switch*
