To implement the BeeGFS on NetApp solution, make sure your environment meets the technology requirements.

== Hardware requirements

The following table lists the hardware components that are required to implement a single second-generation building block design of the BeeGFS on NetApp solution.

NOTE: The hardware components used in any particular implementation of the solution might vary based on customer requirements.


[options="header" cols="10%,20%,70%"]
|===
|Count |Hardware component |Requirements

a|2
a|[[beegfs-file-nodes]]BeeGFS file nodes
a|Each file node should meet or exceed the following configuration to achieve expected performance.

*Verified File Nodes:*

* Lenovo ThinkSystem SR665 V3 Server
* Lenovo ThinkSystem SR665 Server

*Processors:*

* 2x AMD EPYC 7343 16C 3.2 GHz.
* Configured as two NUMA zones.

*Memory:*

* 256GB.
* 16x 16GB TruDDR4 3200MHz (2Rx8 1.2V) RDIMM-A (prefer more smaller DIMMs over fewer larger DIMMs).
* Populated to maximize memory bandwidth.

*PCIe Expansion: Four PCiE Gen4 x16 slots:*

* Two slots per NUMA zone.
* Each slot should provide enough power/cooling for the host card adapter.

*Miscellaneous:*

* Two drives configured in RAID 1 for the OS (1TB 7.2K SATA or better).
* 1GbE port for in-band OS management.
* 1GbE BMC with Redfish API for out-of-band server management.
* Dual hot swap power supplies and performance fans.

|2
|[[eseries-block-nodes]]E-Series block nodes (EF600 array)
a|Each EF600 array requires the following configuration:

* Memory: 256GB (128GB per controller).
* Adapter: 2-port 200Gb/HDR (NVMe/IB).
* Drives: Configured to match desired capacity.

|8
|[[infiniband-adapters]]Nvidia 200Gb/s, 2-Port, Infiniband Adapters (for file nodes).
a|Host card adapters will vary based on the server model used for the file node. Recommendations for verified file nodes include:

* *Lenovo ThinkSystem SR665 V3 Server:*
** MCX755106AS-HEAT ConnectX-7 NDR200 QSFP112 2-port PCIe Gen5 x16 InfiniBand Adapter

* *Lenovo ThinkSystem SR665 Server:*
** MCX653106A-HDAT ConnectX-6 HDR QSFP-56 2-port PCIe Gen4 x16 InfiniBand Adapter



|8
|[[file-node-cables]]File node InfiniBand cables
(for file/block node direct connects)
a|* MCP1650-H001E30 (1m Nvidia Passive Copper cable, IB HDR, up to 200Gbps, QSFP56, 30AWG).

The length can be adjusted to account for longer distances between the file and block nodes if required.

|Varies
|[[switch-cables]]Switch InfiniBand cables
(for file node/storage switch connections)
a|Cabling requirements vary based on the switch model used to connect file nodes to the storage leaf switch. Possible options include:

* *QM9700 Switch:*
** 4x NDR to dual NDR-200 InfiniBand splitter cables
*** Model: MFA7U10-HXXX (Nvidia active fiber cable, OSFP to 2x QSFP56, 400Gb/s to 2 x 200Gb/s). Length will vary.

* *QM8700 Switch:*
** 8x HDR InfiniBand cables. Options include:
*** Model: MCP1650-HXXX (Nvidia passive copper cable, QSFP56, 200Gb/s). Length will vary.
*** Model: MFS1S00-HXXX (Nvidia active fiber cable, QSFP56, 200Gb/s). Length will vary.
