Follow these steps to update the file node's ConnectX-7 adapters to the latest firmware.

== Overview

Updating the ConnectX-7 adapter firmware may be required to support a new MLNX_OFED driver, enable new features, or fix bugs. This guide will use NVIDIA's `mlxfwmanager` utility for adapter updates due to its ease of use and efficiency.

== Upgrade considerations

This guide covers two approaches to updating ConnectX-7 adapter firmware: a rolling update and a two-node cluster update. Choose the appropriate update approach according to your cluster's size. Before performing firmware updates, verify that:

* A supported MLNX_OFED driver is installed, refer to the link:../second-gen/beegfs-technology-requirements.html[technology requirements^].
* Valid backups exist for your BeeGFS filesystem and Pacemaker cluster configuration.
* The cluster is in a healthy state.

== Firmware update preparation

It is recommended to use NVIDIA's `mlxfwmanager` utility to update a node's adapter firmware, which is bundled with NVIDIA's MLNX_OFED driver. Prior to starting the updates, download the adapter's firmware image from link:https://network.nvidia.com/support/firmware/firmware-downloads/[NVIDIA's support site^] and store it on each file node.

NOTE: For Lenovo ConnectX-7 adapters, use the `mlxfwmanager_LES` tool, which is available on NVIDIAâ€™s link:https://network.nvidia.com/support/firmware/lenovo-intelligent-cluster/[OEM firmware^] page.

== Rolling update approach

This approach is recommended for any HA cluster with more than two nodes. This approach involves updating adapter firmware on one file node at a time, allowing the HA cluster to keep servicing requests, though it is recommended to avoid servicing I/O during this time.

. Confirm that the cluster is in an optimal state, with each BeeGFS service running on its preferred node. Refer to link:clusters-examine-state.html[Examine the state of the cluster^] for details.

. Choose a file node to update and place it into standby mode, which drains (or moves) all BeeGFS services from that node:
+
[source,console]
----
pcs node standby <HOSTNAME>
----

. Verify the node's services have drained by running:
+
[source,console]
----
pcs status
----
Verify no services are reporting as `Started` on the node in standby.
+
NOTE: Depending on cluster size, it may take seconds or minutes for BeeGFS services to move to the sister node. If a BeeGFS service fails to start on the sister node, refer to the link:clusters-troubleshoot.html[Troubleshooting Guides^].

. Update the adapter firmware using `mlxfwmanager`.
+
[source,console]
----
 mlxfwmanager -i <path/to/firmware.bin> -u
----
+
Note the `PCI Device Name` for each adapter receiving firmware updates.

. Reset each adapter using the `mlxfwreset` utility to apply the new firmware.
+
NOTE: Some firmware updates may require a reboot to apply the update. Refer to link:https://docs.nvidia.com/networking/display/mftv4310/mlxfwreset+%E2%80%93+loading+firmware+on+5th+generation+devices+tool#src-3566627427_safe-id-bWx4ZndyZXNldOKAk0xvYWRpbmdGaXJtd2FyZW9uNXRoR2VuZXJhdGlvbkRldmljZXNUb29sLW1seGZ3cmVzZXRMaW1pdGF0aW9ucw[NVIDIA's mlxfwreset limitations^] for guidance. If a reboot is required, perform a reboot instead of resetting the adapters.

.. Stop the opensm service:
+
[source,console]
----
systemctl stop opensm
----

.. Execute the following command for each `PCI Device Name` previously noted.
+
[source,console]
----
mlxfwreset -d <pci_device_name> reset -y
----

.. Start the opensm service:
+
[source,console]
----
systemctl start opensm
----

. Run `ibstat` and verify all adapters are running at the desired firmware version:
+
[source,console]
----
ibstat
----

. Start Pacemaker cluster services on the node:
+
[source,console]
----
pcs cluster start <HOSTNAME>
----

. Bring the node out of standby:
+
[source,console]
----
pcs node unstandby <HOSTNAME>
----

. Relocate all BeeGFS services back to their preferred node:
+
[source,console]
----
pcs resource relocate run
----

Repeat these steps for each file node in the cluster until all adapters have been updated.

== Two node cluster update approach

This approach is recommended for HA clusters with only two nodes. This approach is similar to a rolling update but includes additional steps to prevent service downtime when one node's cluster services are stopped.

. Confirm that the cluster is in an optimal state, with each BeeGFS service running on its preferred node. Refer to link:clusters-examine-state.html[Examine the state of the cluster^] for details.
+
. Choose a file node to update and place the node in standby mode, which drains (or moves) all BeeGFS services from that node:
+
[source,console]
----
pcs node standby <HOSTNAME>
----
+
. Verify the node's resources have drained by running:
+
[source,console]
----
pcs status
----
Verify no services are reporting as `Started` on the node in standby.
+
TIP: Depending on cluster size, it may take seconds or minutes for BeeGFS services to report as `Started` on the sister node. If a BeeGFS service fails to start, refer to the link:clusters-troubleshoot.html[Troubleshooting Guides^].

. Place the cluster into maintenance mode.
+
[source,console]
----
pcs property set maintenance-mode=true
----
+
. Update the adapter firmware using `mlxfwmanager`.
+
[source,console]
----
 mlxfwmanager -i <path/to/firmware.bin> -u
----
+
Note the `PCI Device Name` for each adapter receiving firmware updates.

. Reset each adapter using the `mlxfwreset` utility to apply the new firmware.
+
NOTE: Some firmware updates may require a reboot to apply the update. Refer to link:https://docs.nvidia.com/networking/display/mftv4310/mlxfwreset+%E2%80%93+loading+firmware+on+5th+generation+devices+tool#src-3566627427_safe-id-bWx4ZndyZXNldOKAk0xvYWRpbmdGaXJtd2FyZW9uNXRoR2VuZXJhdGlvbkRldmljZXNUb29sLW1seGZ3cmVzZXRMaW1pdGF0aW9ucw[NVIDIA's mlxfwreset limitations^] for guidance.

+
[source,console]
----

+
[source,console]
----
pcs cluster start <HOSTNAME>
----

. Bring the node out of standby:
+
[source,console]
----
pcs node unstandby <HOSTNAME>
----
+
. Take the cluster out of maintenance mode.
+
[source,console]
----
pcs property set maintenance-mode=false
----
+
. Relocate all BeeGFS services back to their preferred node:
+
[source,console]
----
pcs resource relocate run
----

Repeat these steps for each file node in the cluster until all adapters have been updated.
