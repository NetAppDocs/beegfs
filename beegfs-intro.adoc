[.lead]
The BeeGFS on NetApp solution is a NetApp Verified Architecture (NVA) using a BeeGFS parallel filesystem and a NetApp E-Series storage system.

A BeeGFS filesystem backed by NetApp E-Series storage is a proven, integrated solution with a reliable, scalable, and cost-effective infrastructure that keeps pace with your most extreme workloads. BeeGFS and E-Series storage systems have been developed with a strong focus on performance. Both are designed for easy installation and for simplified management and use.

== NetApp Verified Architecture (NVA)

The NVA program provides reference configurations and sizing guidance for specific workloads and use cases. These solutions are thoroughly tested, and are designed to minimize deployment risks and to accelerate time to market.

To learn more about the NVA program, contact your NetApp customer support or sales representative.

== First and second generation architecture

The BeeGFS on NetApp architecture offers a first and second generational design, both including a BeeGFS file system and an NetApp NVMe EF600 storage system. The second generation builds on the first to include these additional benefits:

* Double the performance and capacity while adding only 2U of rack space
* High availability (HA) based on a shared-disk, two-tier hardware design
* External qualification for NVIDIA’s DGX A100 SuperPOD

This site focuses on the design and deployment for the _second_ generation. Information for future generations will be included as they are developed.

[%collapsible]
====
The first generation of BeeGFS on NetApp was designed for machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads using NetApp EF600 NVMe storage systems, the BeeGFS parallel file system, NVIDIA DGX™ A100 systems, and NVIDIA® Mellanox® Quantum™ QM8700 200Gbps IB switches. This design also features 200Gbps InfiniBand (IB) for the storage and compute cluster interconnect fabric to provide customers with a completely IB-based architecture for high-performance workloads.

.More about the second generation:
[%collapsible]
====
The second generation of BeeGFS on NetApp is optimized to meet the performance requirements of demanding workloads including high-performance computing (HPC) and HPC-style machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and similar artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. By incorporating a shared-disk high-availability (HA) architecture, the solution also meets the data durability and availability requirements of enterprises and other organizations that cannot afford downtime or data loss as they look for storage that can scale to keep up with their next generation workloads and use cases. This solution has not only been verified by NetApp, but it also passed external qualification as a storage option for the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD.

== BeeGFS architecture overview

BeeGFS is a parallel file system, which means that files are striped over multiple server nodes to maximize read/write performance and scalability of the file system. The fact that it is clustered indicates that these server nodes work together to deliver a single file system that can be simultaneously mounted and accessed by other server nodes, commonly known as clients. These clients can see and consume the distributed file system similarly to a local file system such as NTFS, XFS, or ext4.

There are four main required BeeGFS components: the management, storage, metadata, and client services that run on a wide range of supported Linux distributions. These services communicate via any TCP/IP or RDMA-capable network, including InfiniBand (IB), Omni-Path (OPA), and RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE). The BeeGFS server (management, storage, and metadata) services are user space daemons, while the client is a native kernel module (patchless). All components can be installed or updated without rebooting, and you can run any combination of services on the same node, including all of them.
