_Include an intro that will work for any of the "generations"_ -- The BeeGFS on NetApp solution is a NetApp Verified Architecture (NVA) that includes a NetApp EF600 all-flash NVMe storage system and a ThinkParQ BeeGFS parallel filesystem to keep pace with extreme workloads.

If you are a NetApp solutions engineer or a customer strategic decision maker, use this site to learn more about architecture design considerations for determining the specific equipment, cabling, and configurations required to support the validated workload.

== NetApp Verified Architectures (NVAs)

The NetApp Verified Architecture program provides customers with reference configurations and sizing
guidance for specific workloads and use cases. These solutions are:
* Thoroughly tested
* Designed to minimize deployment risks
* Designed to accelerate time to market



== First and second generation architectures

The BeeGFS on NetApp architecture offers a first and second generational design, both including a BeeGFS file system and an NetApp NVMe EF600 storage system. However, the second generation builds on the first to include these added features:

* More than doubles performance and capacity while only adding 2U of rack space.
* Introduces high availability based on a shared-disk two-tier hardware design.
* Passed external qualification for NVIDIAâ€™s DGX A100 SuperPOD.
